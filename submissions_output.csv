I was heading over to one of my friends' houses and decided to take a short cut through the local elementary school. Seeing that it was Saturday, I didn't see any harm in it. Before I could exit the school however, I got a phone call and sat down on a bench to answer it. While talking to my Dad I saw the dappled shadows the trees were making with the diffused lighting from the cloudy day. Being the semi-opportunistic photographer I am, I whipped out my phone without ended the phone conversation and began to take pictures of the rough concrete and shadows. After the first two photos, the leaf blew into my shot and completed the composition.

The group of photographers I was with came across a large Ferris wheel set up among the other rides and games for the children. While everyone else was looking up, I chose to look down. I found myself noticing the puddle in the gutter and became fascinated with how the light from the Ferris Wheel both shed colored light on the ground and reflected nicely in the puddle. With a long exposure and a release cable, I was able to preserve what I consider an interesting spin on light in nature ",http://www.jotform.com/uploads/stanfordosa/22337065700143/221342132714911336/_DSC0071.JPG,Yes,1689,January,13,1996

After researching, I learned that the different colors in the sky were created by interactions between electromagnetic radiation (emitted by the sun) and the atmosphere (made up of molecules that interact differently to light of different wavelengths.) When the sun is setting, its rays have to pass through a thicker layer of atmosphere, in which most of the aerosols (tiny particles in air) are concentrated. Lights with lower frequencies such as reds, oranges, yellows, and infrared are less likely to be scattered by the atmosphere than higher-frequency lights such as blue or violet. Because of this, during sunsets, we can see beautiful colors of red, orange, yellow, and blue in the sky. Also, the range of warm and cool temperatures of the different colors give depth to this 2 dimensional photo, making it come alive. This photograph is an iPhone HDR (high dynamic range) photograph, taken while I was in the backseat of the car coming home from school. During the editing process, I used Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.",http://www.jotform.com/uploads/stanfordosa/22337065700143/221340541721473222/Sky_Final.jpg,Yes,1688,November,20,1996

I used a tripod to steady the camera. I  told my friend to light a sparkler and rotate his arm in a circle. I wanted to reflect the light sparks of the sparkler with something so I chose to take the photo at a local creek. I envisioned that the sparkler would look cool in the reflection of the creek, but I did not know it would turn out this way. I liked how the reflection was a bit distorted. I took a different stand point with the theme of ""light in nature"". I wanted to create artificial light and I think I succeeded at it. I think the contrast of the lights and darks is very powerful in this image.  ",http://www.jotform.com/uploads/stanfordosa/22337065700143/221313809091449334/circle.JPG,Yes,1638,August,8,1994

After researching, I learned that the different colors in the sky were created by interactions between electromagnetic radiation (emitted by the sun) and the atmosphere (made up of molecules that react differently to light of different wavelengths.) When the sun is setting, its rays have to pass through a thicker layer of atmosphere, in which most of the aerosols (tiny particles in air) are concentrated. Lights with lower frequencies such as reds, oranges, yellows, and infrared are less likely to be blocked by the atmosphere than higher-frequency lights such as blue or violet. Because of this, during sunsets, we can see beautiful colors of red, orange, yellow, and blue in the sky. Also, the range of warm and cool temperatures of the different colors give depth to this 2 dimensional photo, making it come alive.

If it does exist but is not visible, then what good is it in the first place?
Humans use light to their advantage to the furthest extent possible, myself included. When light is not apparent, we are basically useless. Light is such a beautiful medium to include in a photograph; it provides brilliant traits things that would otherwise seem dull.

“Maybe its like you said before, all of us being cracked open. Like each of us starts out as a watertight vessel. And then things happen - these people leave us, or don’t love us, or don’t get us, or we don’t get them, and we lose and fail and hurt one another. And the vessel starts to crack in places. And I mean, yeah once the vessel cracks open, the end becomes inevitable. Once it starts to rain inside the Osprey, it will never be remodeled. But there is all this time between when the cracks start to open up and when we finally fall apart. And its only that time that we see one another, because we see out of ourselves through our cracks and into others through theirs. When did we see each other face to face? Not until you saw into my cracks and I saw into yours. Before that we were just looking at ideas of each other, like looking at your window shade, but never seeing inside. But once the vessel cracks, the light can get in. The light can get out.”

I thought that their jumps could be really good photos. I started taking pictures with the sun to my back and standing at my normal tall height. I took a few of those but I didn't really like the effect it created. So I tried sitting down. Those were better but still not what I was looking for. Then I tried taking pictures from the front.

It was about 5 PM between dusk and sunset.  There was a strip of light on the brick path in my backyard, but the rest was black.  I immediately grabbed my camera and went outside.  My ISO was low-medium and I set my camera on the ground to act as a tripod.  I did not use flash to black out the background it was purely the camera and the light.  I picked my angle and this was the result.  I find this photograph extremely interesting because it was not yet dark outside, but it looks like it is pitch black.  Also since it was fall, the color of the leaves in contrast to the green moss on the bricks really emphasizes the bright red leaves.  This piece proves to me personally that photography isn't just about pointing and clicking.  It's about paying attention to the world around you, and then pointing and clicking!

Christmas tree worms come in a wide variety of bright colors and are anywhere from 1/4"" to 1 1/2"" tall. These in particular were around 1/2"" tall. All of the the rings around it that look like small feathers are used for catching nutrients and phytoplankton in the water for food. If they sense any movement or shadow around them they will suck down into a tube below them and bring the clearish-red tab over them. You can see it at the base of the christmas tree worms in this photo. Because of this it was extremely difficult to get this shot just right, I had to stay very, very still until the current stopped for just long enough that I could inch myself into position and get the shot.

To get this shot I had to get slightly below a branch of the coral so that the natural blue light coming from the surface of the water 30 feet above would illuminate the nearly invisible spines on it. It took me a small handful of tries to get the shot and in the process I brushed up against and it began stinging almost immediatly. I'm very happy with the end result and it was well worth the small amount of pain that came with it.

But, the light that comes through the thick, dense wilderness is there to help pull me out of it, to go back to the world that I wanted to turn away from, to help me see the good in it. What I mean by all this is that, if you try to lock yourself away, like into nature, there will always be a way to come back to the real world and see no reason why you need to close it out ever again.

Since I'm a amateur photographer, I don't have a detailed explanation on what methods I used. All I could say is the picture was taken at my school, since there are magnificent trees grown and taken care of here, and with ""Auto"" settings. I guess I could also state that I used a Nikon D80 camera with a 50mm lens.",http://www.jotform.com/uploads/stanfordosa/22337065700143/217626056821984267/BrandonDelaCruz_TrappedButEscapable.jpg,Yes,1112,December,21,1995
